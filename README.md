# MSC MINDcraft Single Click 
One-click PowerShell script for setting up a portable MINDcraft installation. 
## This script is designed for users that are having issues getting MINDcraft to run so you just have to edit the profile with the correct API etc.

 The script automatically:
- Creates a self-contained MINDcraft environment to get you going quicky
- Installs Ollama locally if your GPU has 4GB+ memory
- Uses public Ollama servers if local GPU requirements aren't met
- A self-contained portable toolkit with Java, Node.js, Git, Minecraft, and Ollama (VRAM required) that runs entirely from its folder without system modifications.
